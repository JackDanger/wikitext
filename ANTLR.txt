The "antlr" branch corresponds to the original line of development of
the wikitext parser.

I originally tried doing the entire thing in ANTLR but as a newcomer
wasn't ever able to get a working parser up and running. In the end I
settled for an ANTLR-generated lexer and a hand-coded parser.

I later investigated replacing the ANTLR lexer with a Ragel-generated
scanner on the suspicion that it might be faster, and when it turned
out to be so (on the order of ten times faster) I relegated the old
ANTLR code into a branch and merged the Ragel code into "master".
